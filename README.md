# The purpose of this project is to enable data analysis of how people get into car related accidents.

## Current State:
We are able to seperate different types of accidents out and generate a heatmap of where they are most likely to occur.
This enables us to see where certain types of accidents happen more often. We display the data, as well as save it to a csv to make the heatmap protable

For example compare deer accidents to accidents in general:

We can also generate scatter plots that indicate accident severity
